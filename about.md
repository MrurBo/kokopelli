  <h1>About Kokopelli</h1>
  <p>Kokopelli is a small, independent project rooted in Dublin. We create plant blends, incense, and oils in limited batches, with care for both process and intention. Every piece is crafted slowly, by hand, to keep its character and spirit alive.</p>

  <p>The name <strong>Kokopelli</strong> comes from an ancient figure often seen as a bringer of music, growth, and transformation. In the same way, this project celebrates plants as companions on our path — for grounding, for clarity, for connection.</p>

  <h2>Our approach</h2>
  <p>We believe that simple things, made with care, carry their own quiet strength. That’s why we focus on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Respect for plants and tradition</strong> — learning from old knowledge while adapting to the present</li>
    <li><strong>Clarity and honesty</strong> — being open about ingredients, sourcing, and intended use</li>
    <li><strong>Sustainability</strong> — choosing minimal, eco-friendly packaging and mindful production</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why small-batch?</h2>
  <p>Working in small quantities keeps us close to the process. It means every blend, stick of incense, or bottle of oil passes through hands, not machines. This way we can ensure quality, freshness, and a direct relationship with the plants themselves.</p>

  <h2>More than products</h2>
  <p>Kokopelli is not just about what we make, but how it is used. Each blend is meant to be a companion in moments of reflection, ritual, or simple presence — a reminder to pause, breathe, and reconnect.</p>

  <h2>About Kokopelli</h2>
  <p>Kokopelli is a small project based in Dublin, born from love and respect for plants. At its heart is <strong>Rapé (Hapé)</strong> — the sacred Amazonian snuff. Each blend comes directly from indigenous tribes and is prepared by hand, one order at a time, so what you receive is always fresh and treated with care.</p>

  <p>Alongside Rapé, we also share <strong>Lavender oil</strong> from the French Alps — a calming, grounding ally that brings a touch of European soil into our offering.</p>

  <p>The name <strong>Kokopelli</strong> comes from an ancient figure known as a bringer of music, growth, and transformation. For us, it’s a reminder that plants are companions: they help us ground, find clarity, and reconnect with ourselves and the world around us.</p>

  <h3>Our approach</h3>
  <p>We keep things simple, guided by three values:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Respect for tradition</strong> — Rapé is medicine with deep Amazonian roots. We honour these lineages and share with reverence.</li>
    <li><strong>Clarity and honesty</strong> — We are open about our sourcing, ingredients, and intentions.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustainability</strong> — Using minimal packaging and preparing only what is needed, freshly for each order.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why Rapé?</h3>
  <p>Rapé is more than a product — it is a sacred tool. Traditionally used to clear the mind, align the spirit, and ground the body, it holds a special place in prayer and ritual. Each blend we share is received from tribes and packaged fresh by hand for you.</p>

  <h3>And Lavender oil</h3>
  <p>Lavender oil is our gentle European counterpart. Distilled in the French Alps, it carries a calming and grounding presence — a simple way to invite stillness and balance into daily life.</p>

  <p>Together, Rapé and Lavender oil form the essence of Kokopelli: plant allies for clarity, grounding, and connection.</p>
